The app is built with Next.js. It uses PDF.js to parse the PDF file and preview it, and the NVIDIA Nim API with the `mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1` AI model to chat with the PDF text.

The first time you are running this project, you will need to install the dependencies. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
yarn
```

To start the app, run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
